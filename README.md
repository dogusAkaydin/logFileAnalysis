# Log File Analysis

### My code worked fine and produced reasonable results 
    using the big log.txt from Google Drive
### The fancy quotes in the log.txt in insight_test_suite are properly parsed. 
### But it seems the log.txt in insight_test_suite does 
    not have enough number & host variety of 
### entries to satisfy the requirements of the functions.

### Most active hours in the large file turned out to be the early 
    morning hours of July 13, 1995, which is STS 70 
    (Launch of Discovery from Kennedy Space Center on 8:02am EDT)
